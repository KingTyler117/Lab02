# .gitignore
# A .gitignore file is used to manage what parts of a project will not be tracked by Git. This is particularly useful in preventing certain kinds of files from being pushed to a repository on GitHub.
# .DS_Store files created by the Mac operating system, which are just unnecessary clutter when found inside a code project
# Any files containing information (such as personal data, access keys, or authentication tokens) that you want to keep private
# Other kinds of files that should only be maintained locally and not pushed to a project's repository (you'll learn more about these in Code 301)
# Because the .gitignore file name starts with a period, it is a hidden file in the operating sytem. Recall that hidden files can be viewed in your terminal by adding the -a flag to an ls command.
# Following is a sample .gitignore; note that lines that start with a # are comment lines. Feel free to use this .gitignore content for your own projects. Note that when you get to Code 301, you will need a much larger .gitignore file, and a sample will be provided for you then.
