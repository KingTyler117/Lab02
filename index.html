      <br>
      My name is Sarah, and I am a Code201 student. I previously obtained an AAAS from Shoreline Community College, and focused my studies on Graphic Design and Photography. I love to spend my free time playing indoor soccer, singing and playing music, and with my son, Jackson. I My biggest goal is to continually learn- I want to keep breaking the cieling on what I thought was possible for myself. For the last six years, I had worked at the Apple Store, and I am waiting on a new position with Nordstrom's commercial photo studio as an IT Technician.</p>
