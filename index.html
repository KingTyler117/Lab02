LICENSE
It is good practice to include a license in all of your code projects to ensure that anyone who uses your code knows the rights and limitations of that use. For general use, the broad open-source MIT license works well.
Read through the license file once you have cloned your repo, and if you are interested, look at and read the other ones that GitHub offers when initializing a new repository.
README.md
The purpose of a README
The README document is the first point of entry into a code project, and the fundamental source of documentation. When viewing a project on GitHub, the README appears on the entry page immediately beneath the list of files and directories in the project. You will learn in the coming months that working with code with poor documentation can be a pain, so strive to provide good documentation for your work!
What kind of content should be in the README?
General project information (what does it do, who wrote it, who collaborated, which tools are used)
Instructions for installation and use
Information on the license
Acknowledgements, etc.
README-template - The default 201 README template
Also take a look at the following suggested structures. Note the similarities and differences; there is no absolute right/wrong approach. Consider the information that would be helpful to users of your project, and then set one up that is appropriate to your project:
README-Template by GitHub user PurpleBooth
README by GitHub user jxson
Stack Overflow Q/A on "How to write a good README" (reprint)
A Beginner's Guide to Writing a Kickass README
Lastly, remember to keep your README up to date! Don't just create it and then neglect it!
Markdown
README files are written in a language called Markdown. It is a quick and easy way to add formatting to your documentation, and all developers should know Markdown. More than anything else, you'll get to know it by just using it a lot. This document is in Markdown, for instance, so view the Raw version of this document in GitHub to see how the headings, lists, code blocks, etc. were created.
If you'd like to do a tutorial on Markdown, this is a good one.
reset.css
All browsers come with default settings for things like font sizes, padding, borders, and other visual components. This can be frustrating for web developers because when our work created in one environment is viewed in another environment, there may be differences due to varying values of these default settings.
We recommend using Eric Meyer's reset.css file to "zero-out" all of those values so that you are developing from a clean slate.
img/ directory
As we all know, images are a big part of the web. To help contain file-tree clutter with multiple images in a project, it is wise to create an img/ directory, and potentially subdirectories within there, to store and organize your images.
